## Not Funny Introduction
So... Cars and genetics, what can go wrong right? Trying to be God? Yep, simple as that. Ok simple summary, we take an initial sample of cars then we let them go and live their life, when they crash they die, we pick the two best ones (the two cars that last longer) and let them become parents of another 20 newborn little cars with hight expectations and dreams for life and we simply repeat the process everytime until they become better and better and we finnaly reach the perfect population with no problems so they can rule the WORLD (Evil laugh here)

So the track is simply walls, 2D walls so we can create a track and have hitboxes to detect collision. The result is something like this:
